   - **Impact:** Budget overruns and timeline delays
   - **Mitigation:** Regular stakeholder reviews, change management process

2. **Resource Availability**
   - **Risk:** Key personnel unavailability
   - **Impact:** Project delays and knowledge gaps
   - **Mitigation:** Cross-training, documentation, resource planning



## Security and Compliance

### Security Architecture
The security architecture follows a high-security model with comprehensive protection at all layers.


### Authentication & Authorization

- Identity federation with enterprise SSO
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Zero-trust network architecture principles

### Data Protection
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) for key management
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Advanced threat protection and anomaly detection
- Data loss prevention (DLP) policies

### Compliance Framework
The system must comply with the following regulations:
- SOC 2
- GDPR

### Data Protection
- **Data Classification:** Sensitive data identification and labeling
- **Encryption:** Data at rest and in transit encryption using industry standards
- **Access Controls:** Role-based access with principle of least privilege
- **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive logging for security monitoring and compliance

### Security Monitoring
- **SIEM Integration:** Security Information and Event Management
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regular automated security assessments
