# Epic: Review Board Documentation 

## Overview
This epic focuses on building a feature that assists users in generating comprehensive documentation for enterprise architecture review boards. The goal is to streamline the process of creating, reviewing, and approving project documentation to meet enterprise standards.

## Goals
- **Automate Documentation Generation:** Automatically generate documentation based on a predefined enterprise architecture template.
- **Ensure Compliance:** Ensure all required sections of the review board documentation are completed.
- **Streamline Review Process:** Provide a clear and consistent format for review board members to assess projects.
- **Improve User Experience:** Simplify the documentation process for developers and project managers.
- **Reduce Manual Effort:** Minimize the time and effort required to prepare for architecture reviews.

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want to automatically generate a documentation template so that I can quickly start documenting my project for the review board.
- As a project manager, I want to ensure all required documentation sections are filled out so that we can meet compliance standards.
- As an architect, I want to have a consistent and structured format for all project documentation so that I can easily review and approve them.
- As a user, I want to be guided through the documentation process to ensure I don't miss any critical information.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A new command is available to generate the review board documentation template.
- [ ] The generated documentation includes all standard sections required by the enterprise architecture review board.
- [ ] The system validates that all required sections of the documentation are filled out before submission.
- [ ] Users can easily export the documentation to a format suitable for the review board (e.g., PDF, Markdown).
- [ ] The documentation generation process is integrated into the existing CLI.

## Technical Requirements
- **Template Engine:** Use a templating engine (e.g., Handlebars, EJS) to generate documentation from a predefined template.
- **Validation Logic:** Implement validation logic to check for the completeness of the documentation.
- **Export Functionality:** Integrate a library to convert the generated documentation to PDF or other formats.
- **CLI Integration:** Add a new command to the CLI to trigger the documentation generation process.
- **Configuration:** Allow for configuration of the documentation template to accommodate different review board requirements.
