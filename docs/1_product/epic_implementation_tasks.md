# Epic: Implementation Tasks

## Overview
This epic covers the core implementation tasks for the Gemini CLI VS Code extension project.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Development teams need better AI-powered code analysis and documentation tools
- **Solution**: VS Code extension with AI personas, real-time validation, and BMAD methodology
- **Value**: Improved code quality, faster development cycles, better documentation

## Goals
### Primary Goals
- Implement functional VS Code extension with tree data providers
- Create AI persona system for specialized assistance
- Implement BMAD documentation validation
- Provide real-time code analysis capabilities

### Secondary Goals
- Integrate with Gemini CLI backend
- Support multiple programming languages
- Enable collaborative development workflows

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want to see AI personas in VS Code sidebar so I can get specialized help
- As a team lead, I want BMAD validation to ensure proper documentation before development
- As a developer, I want real-time code analysis to catch issues early

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Extension activates without errors
- [ ] All tree data providers show content (no "no data provider" errors)
- [ ] BMAD status accurately reflects documentation completeness
- [ ] AI personas are accessible and functional
- [ ] Extension works in standalone mode without server

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Extension compiles without errors
- [ ] Manual testing shows working tree views
- [ ] BMAD validation correctly identifies missing documentation
- [ ] No escaped JSON or display issues

## Priority
**High** - Core functionality required for MVP

## Estimation
**Story Points**: 13 (Large epic)

## Dependencies
- TypeScript compilation
- VS Code extension API
- Node.js dependencies

## Progress
- [x] Basic extension structure
- [x] Tree data provider implementation
- [x] Command registration and conflict resolution
- [x] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Complete BMAD documentation
- [ ] Final testing and validation

## Status
**In Progress** - Currently working on BMAD documentation completion
