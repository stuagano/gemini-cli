# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Gemini Enterprise Architect VS Code Extension

## Overview
A VS Code extension that provides AI-powered code analysis, documentation validation, and enterprise development workflow support using the BMAD (Business Model Agent Development) methodology.

## Goals
### Primary Goals
- Provide AI-powered code analysis and assistance through specialized personas
- Enforce enterprise documentation standards via BMAD validation
- Enable real-time code quality monitoring and improvement suggestions
- Support collaborative development through agent swarm functionality

### Secondary Goals
- Integrate seamlessly with existing VS Code workflows
- Provide offline/standalone functionality when server is unavailable
- Support multiple programming languages and frameworks
- Enable cost optimization through cloud pricing integration

## User Stories
### Primary User Stories
- As a developer, I want to see AI personas in VS Code sidebar so I can get specialized help for different tasks
- As a team lead, I want BMAD validation to ensure proper documentation before development starts
- As a developer, I want real-time code analysis to catch issues early and improve code quality
- As an architect, I want agent swarm functionality to collaborate on complex technical decisions

### Secondary User Stories  
- As a junior developer, I want learning-oriented AI assistance to improve my skills
- As a DevOps engineer, I want cost optimization insights to manage cloud spending
- As a security engineer, I want automated security validation during development

## Acceptance Criteria
### Must Have
- [ ] Extension activates without errors in VS Code
- [ ] All tree data providers display content (BMAD Status, Personas, Issues, Epics)
- [ ] BMAD validation correctly identifies documentation completeness status
- [ ] AI personas are accessible through sidebar tree view
- [ ] Extension works in standalone mode when server is unavailable
- [ ] No command registration conflicts or duplicate commands
- [ ] Real-time validation handles server connection failures gracefully

### Should Have
- [ ] WebView panels open successfully for detailed views
- [ ] Cost optimization insights display correctly
- [ ] Agent swarm functionality is accessible
- [ ] Performance monitoring operates without blocking UI
- [ ] Error logging is informative but not excessive

### Could Have
- [ ] Gamification elements for cost learning
- [ ] Advanced metrics dashboard
- [ ] Custom theme support for tree views
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

## Success Metrics
### Key Performance Indicators
- Extension activation time: < 2 seconds
- Tree view data load time: < 1 second
- Memory usage: < 50MB baseline
- CPU usage during idle: < 5%
- BMAD validation accuracy: > 95%

### User Satisfaction Metrics
- Extension crash rate: < 0.1% of sessions
- User-reported bugs: < 5 per month
- Documentation compliance improvement: > 80%
- Developer productivity increase: > 20%

## Technical Requirements
### Performance Requirements
- Tree view refresh time: < 500ms
- WebView panel load time: < 1 second
- Extension startup time: < 2 seconds
- Memory footprint: < 100MB under normal usage
- No UI blocking during server communication

### Security Requirements
- Secure handling of API keys and tokens
- No logging of sensitive data or credentials
- Secure communication with backend services
- Input validation for all user-provided data

### Compatibility Requirements
- VS Code version: 1.60.0 or higher
- Node.js version: 16.x or higher
- Operating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux
- TypeScript compilation target: ES2020
- Integration with VS Code extension API v1.60+

## Assumptions and Dependencies
### Assumptions
- Users have VS Code installed and are familiar with extensions
- Development teams want to adopt BMAD methodology
- Server connectivity may be intermittent (standalone mode required)
- Users understand basic AI assistance concepts

### Dependencies
- VS Code Extension API
- TypeScript compiler and Node.js runtime
- Gemini CLI backend service (optional)
- Google Cloud Billing API (for pricing features)
- Vitest testing framework

## Timeline and Milestones
- Phase 1 - Core Extension: Completed (August 2025)
- Phase 2 - BMAD Documentation: In Progress (August 2025)
- Phase 3 - Final Testing: August 2025
- Final Delivery: September 2025

## Risks and Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Server connectivity issues | Medium | High | Implement robust standalone mode with graceful degradation |
| VS Code API changes | High | Low | Pin to stable API versions, implement compatibility checks |
| Performance issues with large codebases | Medium | Medium | Implement lazy loading, pagination, and caching strategies |
| User adoption of BMAD methodology | Medium | Medium | Provide clear documentation and gradual enforcement |
| Google Cloud API rate limits | Low | Medium | Implement caching and fallback pricing data |
