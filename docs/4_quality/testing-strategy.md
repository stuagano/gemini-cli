# Testing Strategy Document

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Gemini Enterprise Architect VS Code Extension project, covering all levels of testing from unit to end-to-end, including performance and security testing.

## Testing Philosophy
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementation
- **Continuous Testing**: Tests run on every commit and PR
- **Shift-Left Testing**: Catch issues early in development
- **Risk-Based Testing**: Focus on critical business functionality
- **Automated First**: Maximize automated test coverage

## Test Levels and Coverage Targets

### 1. Unit Testing
**Coverage Target**: >90% for business logic, >80% overall

**Scope**:
- Individual functions and methods
- Service layer business logic
- Validation rules and calculations
- Utility functions
- Error handling paths

**Framework**: Vitest
**Mocking Strategy**: vi.mock() for external dependencies

**Key Areas**:
- BMAD validation logic
- Financial calculations (ROI, NPV, IRR)
- Document parsing and section detection
- Tree data provider data transformation
- Command handlers

### 2. Integration Testing
**Coverage Target**: >75% for API interactions

**Scope**:
- VS Code Extension API integration
- Backend service communication
- Database interactions
- External API integrations
- File system operations

**Framework**: Vitest with VS Code test utilities
**Test Environment**: Isolated test workspace

**Key Areas**:
- Extension activation and deactivation
- Tree view data display
- WebView communication
- Command registration
- Settings management

### 3. Component Testing
**Coverage Target**: >85% for UI components

**Scope**:
- React components (for WebViews)
- Tree view providers
- User interaction flows
- State management
- Event handling

**Framework**: Vitest + Testing Library
**Approach**: Render components in isolation

**Key Areas**:
- Tree item rendering
- WebView panels
- Empty states
- Error boundaries
- Loading states

### 4. End-to-End Testing
**Coverage Target**: 100% of critical user journeys

**Scope**:
- Complete user workflows
- Multi-component interactions
- Real backend integration
- Cross-feature scenarios

**Framework**: VS Code Extension Tester
**Environment**: Docker containers for consistency

**Critical User Journeys**:
1. Extension installation and first-time setup
2. BMAD validation workflow (create → validate → fix)
3. AI persona interaction (select → chat → receive response)
4. Cloud pricing analysis (estimate → validate → optimize)
5. Epic and story management workflow

### 5. Performance Testing
**Targets**:
- Extension activation: <2 seconds
- Tree view refresh: <500ms
- Validation complete: <3 seconds
- WebView load: <1 second
- Memory usage: <100MB baseline

**Tools**:
- VS Code Performance Profiler
- Chrome DevTools (for WebViews)
- Custom performance benchmarks

**Scenarios**:
- Large workspace validation (>1000 files)
- Concurrent user operations
- Network latency simulation
- Memory leak detection
- CPU usage monitoring

### 6. Security Testing
**Focus Areas**:
- API key and token handling
- Input validation and sanitization
- XSS prevention in WebViews
- Secure communication (HTTPS/WSS)
- File system access controls

**Tools**:
- Static code analysis (ESLint security plugins)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (npm audit)
- OWASP security checklist
- Penetration testing (quarterly)

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Strategy
- **Fixtures**: Predefined test documents and configurations
- **Factories**: Generate test data programmatically
- **Mocks**: Simulate external service responses
- **Snapshots**: Capture expected outputs for regression testing

### Test Data Categories
1. **Valid BMAD Documents**: Complete, properly formatted documents
2. **Invalid Documents**: Missing sections, incorrect formats
3. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions, special characters
4. **Performance Data**: Large files, many files
5. **Error Scenarios**: Network failures, invalid responses

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Testing

### CI Pipeline Stages
1. **Pre-commit**: Linting, formatting, type checking
2. **Build**: Compilation and bundling
3. **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated tests
4. **Integration Tests**: API and service tests
5. **E2E Tests**: Critical path validation
6. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark comparisons
7. **Security Scan**: Dependency and code analysis

### Test Execution Strategy
- **On Commit**: Unit tests, linting
- **On PR**: Full test suite except E2E
- **On Merge**: Complete test suite including E2E
- **Nightly**: Performance and security tests
- **Weekly**: Full regression suite

## Test Environment Management

### Environment Types
1. **Local Development**: Developer machines
2. **CI Environment**: GitHub Actions runners
3. **Staging**: Pre-production validation
4. **Production-like**: Performance testing

### Environment Configuration
- Isolated test workspaces
- Mock external services
- Test-specific configurations
- Clean state between tests

## Defect Management

### Defect Classification
- **Critical**: Blocks core functionality
- **Major**: Significant feature impact
- **Minor**: Cosmetic or edge cases
- **Enhancement**: Improvement opportunities

### Defect Metrics
- Defect density per component
- Mean time to detection
- Mean time to resolution
- Defect escape rate
- Test effectiveness ratio

## Test Automation Framework

### Framework Components
```typescript
// Test utilities
export const TestUtils = {
  createMockWorkspace(): vscode.WorkspaceFolder
  createMockDocument(content: string): vscode.TextDocument
  createMockExtensionContext(): vscode.ExtensionContext
  waitForTreeUpdate(provider: TreeDataProvider): Promise<void>
  mockGeminiClient(responses: any[]): GeminiClient
}

// Custom matchers
expect.extend({
  toBeValidBMADDocument(received: Document): MatcherResult
  toHaveTreeItem(received: TreeDataProvider, expected: string): MatcherResult
  toShowNotification(received: any, message: string): MatcherResult
})
```
