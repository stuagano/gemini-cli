## üìù Notes

The project has made significant progress with core functionality complete and working. The BMAD validation system is enforcing documentation requirements effectively, and the VS Code extension provides a comprehensive development environment.

The transformation of the BMAD Status view into a project documentation hub with visual indicators (red/green) for required vs optional documents significantly improves the developer experience and makes it clear what documentation is needed before development can proceed.

The addition of the Project Explorer and Launch Gemini CLI button makes the extension more functional and user-friendly.
