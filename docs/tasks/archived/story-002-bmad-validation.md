# User Story: BMAD Documentation Validation System

## Description
As a team lead, I want the extension to validate project documentation against BMAD requirements so that I can ensure all projects have proper business justification and documentation before development begins.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Validator checks for all required BMAD documents (PRD, business case, cloud estimates, etc.)
- [x] Each document is validated for required sections and content
- [x] Validation score is calculated (0-100%)
- [x] Missing sections are clearly identified with actionable feedback
- [x] Validation runs automatically every 30 seconds
- [x] Manual refresh command is available
- [ ] Custom requirements can be configured via settings
- [x] Templates generated for missing documents
- [x] Critical errors block development activities
- [x] Validation results are cached for performance
- [x] BMAD Status shows project overview with required/optional document indicators
- [x] Red/green color coding for missing/existing required documents

## Tasks
- [x] Create BMADValidator service class
- [x] Implement document parsing and section detection
- [x] Create validation rules for each document type
- [x] Implement scoring algorithm
- [x] Add auto-refresh timer with configurable interval
- [x] Create template generation system
- [ ] Add custom requirements configuration loading
- [x] Implement caching layer for validation results
- [x] Add development blocking mechanism
- [ ] Write comprehensive test suite
- [x] Transform BMAD Status into project documentation hub
- [x] Add required/optional flags to documents

## Definition of Done
- [x] All BMAD documents are correctly validated
- [x] Scoring algorithm produces accurate results
- [x] Missing sections are properly identified
- [x] Templates generate correctly
- [x] Auto-refresh works reliably
- [ ] Custom configurations load properly
- [x] Performance targets met (<3s validation time)
- [ ] Unit tests achieve >95% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests pass all scenarios
- [x] Documentation complete

## Technical Notes
- Use filesystem watchers for document changes
- Cache validation results with TTL
- Support both workspace and global configurations
- Use async validation to avoid blocking UI

## Story Points
**8** - High complexity, critical business logic

## Dependencies
- File system access
- Configuration management
- Template engine
- Markdown parser
