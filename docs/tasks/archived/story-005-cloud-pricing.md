# User Story: Real-time Cloud Pricing Integration

## Description
As a DevOps engineer, I want real-time cloud pricing validation using Google Cloud Billing API so that I can accurately forecast costs and identify optimization opportunities before deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Google Cloud Billing API integration is functional
- [x] Real-time pricing data updates at least hourly
- [x] Cost estimates include all resource types (compute, storage, network)
- [x] 3-year cost projections are calculated
- [x] Optimization recommendations are provided
- [ ] Cost comparison between different architectures
- [ ] Budget alerts are configured at 70%, 90%, 100%
- [x] Fallback pricing data when API is unavailable
- [ ] Export cost reports in multiple formats
- [ ] Historical cost tracking and trends

## Tasks
- [x] Set up Google Cloud Billing API authentication
- [x] Create pricing data fetch service
- [x] Implement cost calculation engine
- [x] Build projection algorithms
- [x] Create optimization recommendation system
- [ ] Add architecture comparison tool
- [ ] Implement budget alert system
- [x] Create fallback pricing database
- [ ] Build report generation system
- [ ] Add historical data storage
- [x] Implement caching for API responses
- [x] Write comprehensive test suite

## Definition of Done
- [x] API integration works reliably
- [x] Pricing data is accurate and current
- [x] Calculations match Google Cloud Calculator
- [x] Optimization recommendations are actionable
- [ ] Budget alerts trigger correctly
- [x] Fallback mode works seamlessly
- [ ] Reports are comprehensive and clear
- [x] Performance targets met (<1s for calculations)
- [x] Test coverage >85%
- [x] Security review completed for API keys

## Technical Notes
- Cache API responses for 1 hour
- Use exponential backoff for API failures
- Store pricing history in database
- Support multi-region pricing

## Story Points
**8** - Complex external integration, accuracy critical

## Dependencies
- Google Cloud Billing API access
- API authentication credentials
- Pricing database schema
- Report templates
