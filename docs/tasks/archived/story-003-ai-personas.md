# User Story: AI Persona Integration

## Description
As a developer, I want to interact with specialized AI personas (Scout, Architect, Guardian, etc.) through the VS Code extension so that I can get expert assistance tailored to specific development tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All AI personas are accessible through the sidebar tree view
- [x] Each persona displays its specialization and capabilities
- [x] Clicking a persona opens a chat/interaction interface
- [x] Personas maintain context during conversations
- [x] Scout runs automatically before code generation
- [x] Architect provides system design recommendations
- [x] Guardian performs security analysis
- [x] Personas work together in swarm mode for complex tasks
- [x] Interaction history is preserved
- [x] Offline mode provides cached responses or graceful degradation

## Tasks
- [x] Define persona interfaces and capabilities
- [x] Create persona registry and management system
- [x] Implement chat interface for each persona
- [x] Add context management for conversations
- [x] Integrate Scout pre-check system
- [x] Create Architect analysis engine
- [x] Implement Guardian security scanner
- [x] Build swarm coordination logic
- [x] Add conversation history storage
- [x] Implement offline mode fallbacks
- [x] Create persona-specific prompt templates
- [ ] Write tests for each persona

## Definition of Done
- [x] All personas are functional and accessible
- [x] Chat interfaces work smoothly
- [x] Context is maintained across interactions
- [x] Scout pre-checks prevent duplicates
- [x] Swarm mode coordinates multiple personas
- [x] History is saved and retrievable
- [x] Offline mode handles gracefully
- [x] Performance meets targets (<2s response time)
- [ ] Test coverage >85%
- [x] User documentation complete

## Technical Notes
- Use WebView for rich chat interfaces
- Implement message passing between extension and personas
- Cache persona responses for offline access
- Use streaming for real-time responses

## Story Points
**13** - Very high complexity, multiple integrations

## Dependencies
- Gemini API integration
- WebView API
- Message passing framework
- Conversation storage system
