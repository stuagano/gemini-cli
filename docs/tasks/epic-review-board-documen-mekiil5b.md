# Epic: Review Board Documentation 

## Overview
This epic focuses on building a feature that assists users in generating comprehensive documentation for enterprise architecture review boards. The goal is to streamline the process of creating, reviewing, and approving project documentation to meet enterprise standards.

## Goals
- **Automate Documentation Generation:** Automatically generate documentation based on a predefined enterprise architecture template.
- **Ensure Compliance:** Ensure all required sections of the review board documentation are completed.
- **Streamline Review Process:** Provide a clear and consistent format for review board members to assess projects.
- **Improve User Experience:** Simplify the documentation process for developers and project managers.
- **Reduce Manual Effort:** Minimize the time and effort required to prepare for architecture reviews.

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want to automatically generate a documentation template so that I can quickly start documenting my project for the review board.
- As a project manager, I want to ensure all required documentation sections are filled out so that we can meet compliance standards.
- As an architect, I want to have a consistent and structured format for all project documentation so that I can easily review and approve them.
- As a user, I want to be guided through the documentation process to ensure I don't miss any critical information.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] A new command is available to generate the review board documentation template.
- [x] The generated documentation includes all standard sections required by the enterprise architecture review board.
- [x] The system validates that all required sections of the documentation are filled out before submission.
- [x] Users can easily export the documentation to a format suitable for the review board (e.g., PDF, Markdown).
- [x] The documentation generation process is integrated into the existing CLI.
- [x] Multi-agent collaboration system implemented with specialized AI personas.
- [x] Fault-tolerant architecture with health monitoring and auto-recovery.
- [x] Enterprise-grade deployment and scaling capabilities.
- [x] Production-ready monitoring and observability features.

## Technical Requirements
- **Template Engine:** Use a templating engine (e.g., Handlebars, EJS) to generate documentation from a predefined template.
- **Validation Logic:** Implement validation logic to check for the completeness of the documentation.
- **Export Functionality:** Integrate a library to convert the generated documentation to PDF or other formats.
- **CLI Integration:** Add a new command to the CLI to trigger the documentation generation process.
- **Configuration:** Allow for configuration of the documentation template to accommodate different review board requirements.

## Swarm Architecture Implementation

### Multi-Agent Collaboration Strategy
The epic review board documentation will leverage the claudeflow swarm architecture to provide intelligent, collaborative documentation generation using specialized AI personas:

#### Primary Agent Personas:
- **The Architect** (Coordinator): Technical solution design, architectural patterns, coordination
- **Business Value Analyst**: Executive summaries, ROI calculations, business context
- **Scout**: Project structure analysis, technology stack identification, dependency mapping
- **Guardian**: Security compliance, risk assessment, regulatory validation
- **DevOps Engineer**: Operational readiness, deployment strategies, monitoring requirements
- **Project Manager**: Quality assurance, completeness validation, process coordination

#### Task Decomposition Flow:
1. **Discovery Phase** (Parallel Execution):
   - Scout: Analyze project structure and dependencies
   - Business Value Analyst: Identify business context and drivers
   - Guardian: Scan security and compliance requirements

2. **Core Documentation Phase** (Parallel with Dependencies):
   - Architect: Design technical solution and architecture overview
   - Business Value Analyst: Create executive summary and business case
   - DevOps Engineer: Plan operational readiness and deployment strategy

3. **Integration & Validation Phase** (Sequential):
   - Architect: Integrate all sections for technical coherence
   - Project Manager: Validate completeness and quality
   - Guardian: Final compliance and security review

#### Enhanced Template Processing:
- **Dynamic Content Generation**: AI-generated content based on actual project analysis
- **Context-Aware Placeholders**: Smart template replacement using Handlebars with custom helpers
- **Conditional Sections**: Show/hide sections based on project type and requirements
- **Multi-format Output**: Generate Markdown, PDF, HTML, and Word documents

#### Intelligent Validation System:
- **Structure Validation**: Ensure all required sections are present and properly formatted
- **Content Quality Assessment**: AI evaluation of completeness and technical accuracy
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Verify documentation matches actual project artifacts
- **Compliance Checking**: Validate against enterprise standards and regulatory requirements
- **Business Alignment**: Ensure technical solution aligns with stated business objectives

#### CLI Integration Enhancement:
```bash
# Swarm-powered documentation generation
