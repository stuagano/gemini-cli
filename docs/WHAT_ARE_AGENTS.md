## Industry Definition

### What is an AI Agent?
An **AI Agent** is an autonomous software entity that can:
- üéØ **Perceive** its environment (read code, analyze data)
- ü§î **Reason** about what actions to take
- üé¨ **Act** to achieve specific goals
- üìö **Learn** from interactions (though our agents are currently stateless)

### Key Characteristics
1. **Autonomy**: Operates without constant human intervention
2. **Goal-Oriented**: Works toward specific objectives
3. **Reactive**: Responds to changes in environment
4. **Proactive**: Takes initiative to achieve goals

### Industry Examples
- **GitHub Copilot**: Code completion agent
- **ChatGPT Plugins**: Agents that can browse web, run code
- **AutoGPT**: Fully autonomous task-completion agent
- **LangChain Agents**: Tool-using agents for complex workflows

## Google's Definition

According to Google's AI documentation, agents are:

> "AI agents are systems that can use language models to interact with the world. They can break down complex tasks, create a plan, and execute the steps to achieve a goal."

### Google's Agent Characteristics
- **Tool Use**: Can call APIs, databases, other services
- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Break complex problems into steps
- **Context Awareness**: Understand project/domain context

1. **Search Agents**: Information retrieval and synthesis
2. **Data Agents**: Database queries and analysis
3. **Code Agents**: Code generation and modification
4. **Creative Agents**: Content creation and design

## Our Implementation in This Project

### What Are Agents Here?
In the Gemini CLI project, **agents are specialized AI personas** that:
- Have specific expertise domains
- Use defined tools and workflows
- Follow software development best practices
- Collaborate like a real development team

### Architecture
```

### Key Differences from Basic LLMs
| Basic LLM | Our Agents |
|-----------|------------|
| General responses | Specialized expertise |
| No memory between calls | Maintains project context |
| Single perspective | Multiple viewpoints |
| Text-only output | Structured deliverables |
| No role consistency | Consistent personas |

## The 7 Specialized Agents

### 1. üéØ Analyst Agent (`analyst`)
**Role**: Business & Technical Analysis
- Translates business requirements to technical specs
- Performs feasibility analysis
- Creates user stories and acceptance criteria
- Identifies risks and dependencies

**Example Use**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:2000/api/v1/agent/request \
  -d '{"agent": "analyst", "prompt": "Analyze requirements for adding OAuth to our API"}'
```

### 2. üìã Project Manager Agent (`pm`)
**Role**: Project Planning & Coordination
- Creates project timelines
- Breaks down epics into tasks
- Estimates effort and resources
- Tracks progress and blockers

**Example Use**:
```bash
# "Create a 3-sprint plan for implementing real-time notifications"
```

### 3. üèóÔ∏è Architect Agent (`architect`)
**Role**: System Design & Architecture
- Designs system components
- Chooses technology stacks
- Creates architecture diagrams
- Ensures scalability and performance

**Example Use**:
```bash
# "Design a microservices architecture for our e-commerce platform"
```

### 4. üíª Developer Agent (`developer`)
**Role**: Code Implementation
- Writes production-ready code
- Implements features and fixes
- Follows coding best practices
- Creates unit tests

**Example Use**:
```bash
# "Implement a Redis caching layer for user sessions"
```

### 5. üß™ QA Agent (`qa`)
**Role**: Quality Assurance & Testing
- Creates test plans
- Writes test cases
- Performs code reviews
- Identifies edge cases

**Example Use**:
```bash
# "Create comprehensive test suite for payment processing"
```

### 6. üîç Scout Agent (`scout`)
**Role**: Code Analysis & Duplication Detection
- Finds duplicate code patterns
- Analyzes codebase health
- Suggests refactoring opportunities
- Prevents redundant implementations

**Example Use**:
```bash
# "Check if we already have authentication logic before implementing"
```

### 7. üé® Product Owner Agent (`po`)
**Role**: Product Strategy & Prioritization
- Defines product vision
- Prioritizes features
- Manages backlog
- Aligns with business goals

**Example Use**:
```bash
# "Prioritize features for next quarter based on user feedback"
```

## How Agents Work

### 1. Request Flow
```python
# User sends request
{
  "agent": "architect",
  "prompt": "Design a caching strategy",
  "context": {...}
}

# Agent processes with:
- Domain expertise
- Project context
- Best practices
- Tool access

# Returns structured response
{
  "result": "Detailed architecture plan...",
  "artifacts": ["diagrams", "specs"],
  "next_steps": [...]
}
```

### 2. Agent Capabilities
Each agent can:
- **Access Knowledge Base**: Query documentation and code
- **Use Tools**: File operations, web search, code analysis
- **Maintain Context**: Understand project state
- **Collaborate**: Hand off to other agents

### 3. Stateless Operation
Currently, agents are **stateless between calls**:
- Each request is independent
- Context must be provided explicitly
- No learning between sessions
- Consistent behavior

## Why Use Agents?

### Benefits Over Direct LLM Use

#### 1. **Specialized Expertise**
- ‚ùå Generic LLM: "Here's some code that might work"
- ‚úÖ Developer Agent: "Here's production-ready code with tests, following your project's patterns"

#### 2. **Consistent Perspective**
- ‚ùå Generic LLM: Mixed viewpoints in responses
- ‚úÖ QA Agent: Always thinks about edge cases, testing, quality

#### 3. **Better Organization**
- ‚ùå Generic LLM: Everything in one conversation
- ‚úÖ Agent System: Clear separation of concerns

#### 4. **Team Simulation**
- ‚ùå Generic LLM: Single perspective
- ‚úÖ Agent Team: Multiple viewpoints like a real team

### Real-World Example

**Task**: "Build a user authentication system"

**Without Agents**: Single LLM gives you a monolithic response mixing architecture, code, and testing.

**With Agents**:
1. **Analyst**: Defines requirements (MFA, OAuth, password policies)
2. **Architect**: Designs system (JWT, Redis sessions, DB schema)
3. **Developer**: Implements code (auth endpoints, middleware)
4. **QA**: Creates test suite (unit, integration, security tests)
5. **Scout**: Checks for existing auth code to reuse

## Getting Started

### Quick Test
```bash
# Start the agent server
./start_agent_server.sh

# Ask architect to design something
curl -X POST http://localhost:2000/api/v1/agent/request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent": "architect",
    "prompt": "Design a simple REST API for a todo app"
  }'
```

### Using from Code
```javascript
// JavaScript/TypeScript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:2000/api/v1/agent/request', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    agent: 'developer',
    prompt: 'Implement the todo API endpoint'
  })
});
```

```python
# Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'http://localhost:2000/api/v1/agent/request',
    json={
        'agent': 'qa',
        'prompt': 'Write tests for the todo API'
    }
)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Agent Collaboration
Agents can work together:
```python
# PM creates plan ‚Üí Architect designs ‚Üí Developer implements ‚Üí QA tests
workflow = [
    ('pm', 'Create sprint plan for feature X'),
    ('architect', 'Design architecture for feature X'),
    ('developer', 'Implement feature X based on architecture'),
    ('qa', 'Test feature X implementation')
]
```

### Context Passing
Provide context for better responses:
```json
{
  "agent": "developer",
  "prompt": "Add caching to getUserById",
  "context": {
    "language": "TypeScript",
    "framework": "Express",
    "database": "PostgreSQL",
    "existing_code": "..."
  }
}
```

## FAQ

### Q: Do agents remember previous conversations?
A: Currently no. Each request is independent. Context must be passed explicitly.

### Q: Can agents talk to each other?
A: Yes, through the Nexus orchestrator, agents can hand off tasks to other agents.

### Q: What makes these different from ChatGPT?
A: Specialization, consistency, and integration with development tools.

### Q: Do I need Google Cloud for agents?
A: No! Agents work completely offline. Google Cloud only enhances RAG (retrieval) capabilities.
